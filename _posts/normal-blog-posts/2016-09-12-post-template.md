This fall term, I suddenly felt the urge to create my own porfolio.
To learn about CSS/HTML, to  accomplish something using the coding skills I learned through out this summer.
I owned a Wordpress blog in the past and it was one of the greatest experience of my life.
The kindness and passion of complete strangers is a pure feeling of happiness.
The great thing about a personal website is the possibilities it offers and I am excited to see how this website will turn out.

Today, I completed my nav bar and footer. There are still some issues with the formatting but I will work on them later this week when I have the time.
The hope is to get something presentable before next Monday.
